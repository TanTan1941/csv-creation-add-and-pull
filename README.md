# csv-creation-add-and-pull

In 'csv_search_final.py', the 'runnning' and 'still running' prints were put there to check the state to which it got to before failing.


The common usage of 'user_add.py' would be adding multiple names in the script itself.


The common usage of 'csv_useradd.py' would would be to add one single user quickly from terminal, or user input perspective.


The common usage of 'csv_useradd_multiple.py' would be adding multiple names from terminal.


The common usage of 'csv_search.py' would be to search the csv file for a user inputted name.


Any feedback or tips would be greatly appreciated, negative or positive.
