# csv-creation-add-and-pull

In 'csv_search_final.py', the 'runnning' and 'still running' prints were put there to check the state to which it got to before failing.

'csv_user_add' is still in progress and, will allow a user to add to the csv through user input.

Any feedback or tips would be greatly appreciated, negative or positive.
